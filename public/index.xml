      <description>D-Day Dice Pocket is one of the games I backed on Kickstarter. The Kickstarter campaign was actually for D-Day Dice: 2nd Edition and D-Day Dice Pocket came in the package on higher pledge levels. I&amp;rsquo;m yet to try the main D-Day Dice game, but judging from the experience while playing its smaller brother, it might actually be quite fun.
D-Day Dice Pocket actually contains two games in one small package - D-Day Dice Battle!</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my attempt of blogging about board gaming hobby. My name is Miroslav Popovic and I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer by trade. Hopefully, this blog will be more productive than the other one about the software development.
My first foray into the world of modern board gaming happened several years ago, when I discovered board games category on Kickstarter. I quickly became addicted. Now I&amp;rsquo;m a (not so) proud owner of 150+ board games.</description>
