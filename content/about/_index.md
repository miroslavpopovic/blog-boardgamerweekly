description: "What is this BoardGamerWeekly thing?"
---

This blog is created and maintained by [Miroslav Popovic](https://miroslavpopovic.com/), a software developer by trade and a board game addict. It represents an escape from regular daily routine and an attempt to fight with the growing shelf of shame :).

BoardGamerWeekly first started its life as [a weekly newsletter](https://boardgamerweekly.com/) for the board gaming hobby. After 16 issues, and about 500 regular subscribers, other responsibilities slowly crept in and caused a difficult decision to stop the newsletter publishing. The archive of passed issues remained available at the old address - https://boardgamerweekly.com. It is now joined by this blog subdomain.

The blog will contain some thoughts about the hobby, interesting findings and board game reviews. However, there is no plan to post regularly.

Hope you'll find the content fun and useful!
