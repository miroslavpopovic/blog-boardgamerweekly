      <description>D-Day Dice Pocket is one of the games I backed on Kickstarter. The Kickstarter campaign was actually for D-Day Dice: 2nd Edition and D-Day Dice Pocket came in the package on higher pledge levels. I&amp;rsquo;m yet to try the main D-Day Dice game, but judging from the experience while playing its smaller brother, it might actually be quite fun.
D-Day Dice Pocket actually contains two games in one small package - D-Day Dice Battle!</description>
