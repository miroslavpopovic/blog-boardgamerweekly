Hello and welcome to my attempt of blogging about board gaming hobby. My name is [Miroslav Popovic](https://miroslavpopovic.com/) and I'm a software developer by trade. Hopefully, this blog will be more productive than the other one about the software development.

My first foray into the world of modern board gaming happened several years ago, when I discovered [board games category on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/games/tabletop%20games?sort=newest). I quickly became addicted. Now I'm a (not so) proud owner of 150+ board games. At the start of 2017 I have started to publish a newsletter about board gaming, called [BoardGamerWeekly](https://boardgamerweekly.com/). After 16 issues, it was put on hold, as I didn't have enough free time to run it. It's still available as [an archive](https://boardgamerweekly.com/).

So, I'm back again, but in another form. This blog is an escape from the regular daily routine of a software developer, and an attempt to push myself through my shelf of shame. For now, I plan to post reviews of the board games I have played. All the current and future reviews are available on the [reviews page](/reviews/). Later on, I might expand into writing my general thoughts about the hobby, cover some new releases, etc. No promises though :).

Let's see how this post is going to age...
